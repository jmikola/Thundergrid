Thundergallery is a free and open source image gallery, powered by 
MongoDB (a NoSQL database) & PHP.

We hope people will take the code, hack it, develop upon it, and use it 
as a learning tool for NoSQL databases such as Mongo.

We're currently in development stages, although when we have something 
we think you can use, we'll push it up to GitHub for you to hack.
